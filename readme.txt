--- 3D REAL-TIME ANIMATION - "THE LITTLE ROOSTER AND LITTLE ----
--- HEN: ADVENTURES AT THE TOP OF NUT MOUNTAIN -----------------
----------------------------------------------------------------

Produced by: Brandon Ly

Based on the Grimm Fairy Tale "Death of the Little Hen"

---

This is a project that I worked on for an elective, special topics
course at UCLA, specializing in 3D Real-time Animation.

I used the Unity 3D Game Engine (version 4.7.6 at time of production) to create
and produce the animation; I programmed C# scripts, imported 3D models of various
formats, and scripted model and scene animations to create and direct the scenes
of my animation. I also did the narration and image text using a voice recorder
and image editor software.

Here is the source code and assets for my projects. To take a view of the
credits for this project, please refer to the credits section of this readme.

------ MID-WAY PUNCHLIST -------
--------------------------------

Finish up other scenes - Well, I need to finish the other scenes, so...

Make Ragdoll Physics work with animating - I want to figure out a way to make objects
    react to ragdoll physics even as they're animated. Otherwise, I must figure out a
    way to animate characters in scenes without Unity's default animation tool.
 
Make things look less like Unity - Make my animation look less like Unity, of course!
    I intend to use different skyboxes, different grasses, and different trees, ideally.
    I might use out-of-place objects (like modern city buildings and stuff I guess).

Find background music - I want to use some nice 90s-era cartoon music (or some other
    funny, sarcastic music to use) to complement my animation and add to the 
    style of it.

Decicde between narrating myself or text-to-speech - I recently got feedback about my
    animation from classmates, and they mentioned that the thing that really gave it its
    charm was the text-to-speech I used for the scenes. This poses a dilemma for me. I
    originally wanted to narrate the animation myself in a funny voice, but if the
    text-to-speech works better, then I might go down that road myself.

Figure out a way to use my 'buffRooster' model - For some reason, whenever I load
    my 'buffRooster' model it lags Unity ... I want to use this for a specific
    scene and need to figure out how to 'unlag' it. Otherwise, I'll have to figure something
    else out.

Find out way to import Witcher 2 Models - I found really cool and nice models I would
    like to use from the Witcher 2 video game! Thankfully, CD Projekt RED, the developers
    of the game, officially permit use of their models, etc so long as it is not for
    commercial reasons. At the moment, I am trying to find a way to convert the raw
    exports of the models that I have right now into compatible model formats (fbx, obj, etc)
    to use with my animation.

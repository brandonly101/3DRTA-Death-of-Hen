Laurel Wreath***

The Laurel Wreath is a circular, interlocking head piece, made from the branches of the bay laurel, and worn in ancient times by the Romans and Greeks as a symbol of victory and other achievements.  This 3D representation has been UV Unwrapped, and comes complete with detailed diffuse (color), specular (reflection), bump, and a translucency map (optional for the leaves).  I've also included UV Templates for both the crown and leaves, if you should desire to create your own maps.  Seamless procedural materials will work well with this model, as the leaves are all completely modeled as manifold geometry, and do not depend on opacity maps.  The entire object, which consists of two elements (leaves and crown), is made up of 21,416 quad polygons, and 21,527 vertices.

The model has been scaled to work with the default Daz Studio mannequin, Genesis 2 Female, but can be resized to fit many other characters I would imagine.  OBJ users, for best results, please read the specific instructions below for detailed guidance on exactly which file to import into your application of choice, as they were all exported to application-specific scale.  Please note that you may need to manually adjust or add texure maps after import, as the OBJ file format is does not support certain map import functionality.  It's up to you to tweak the maps and materials to get optimum results in the render.

You are free to use or modify this model as you see fit for your own projects or scenes. As with all my freebies, this model can be used for both commercial and non-commercial renders. You may NOT, however, resell or redistribute these models or textures, or any derivative of them; individually, or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ USERS: There are 3 different OBJ files, and one MTL file for this model.  You will notice that two of the three OBJ files are labeled for specific applications (Poser and Blender).  It's recommended to use these in the specific application.  POSER USERS:  The OBJ with (POSER) suffix was exported with a scale conversion that will allow the object to load with appropriate scaling into Poser 9 and above, or Daz Studio 4 and above, with Poser import settings. To import this file into Poser, please BE SURE to DE-select all the check box options in the OBJ Import Options dialogue box. DESELECT the "Centered", "Place On Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. so that no options are checked.  This will import the object exactly as intended into the scene, with proper scaling.  DAZ STUDIO users: Select "File/Import", then navigate to the folder on your hard drive that contains the model in this pack.  Choose the "(POSER).obj".  In the Import Options dialogue box, pick the Poser (1unit=8ft) option in the "FROM" dropdown list.  Be sure all other options are checked, and click "Accept".  BLENDER USERS:  Select the "(BLENDER).obj".  All other software packages should import the standard "(STANDARD).obj".

All textures and UV's were created by me.  Most of the original reference textures were from CGTextures.com texture resource website, as well as other royalty-free texture repositories. You are not allowed to redistribute these textures in any way.  Please refer to CGTextures website for specific restrictions regarding the distribution of textures.

Thanks,

Finish up other scenes - Well, I need to finish the other scenes, so...

Make Ragdoll Physics work with animating - I want to figure out a way to make objects
	react to ragdoll physics even as they're animated. Otherwise, I must figure out a
	way to animate characters in scenes without Unity's default animation tool.
 
Make things look less like Unity - Make my animation look less like Unity, of course!
	I intend to use different skyboxes, different grasses, and different trees, ideally.
	I might use out-of-place objects (like modern city buildings and stuff I guess).

Find background music - I want to use some nice 90s-era cartoon music (or some other
	funny, sarcastic music to use) to complement my animation and add to the 
	style of it.

Decicde between narrating myself or text-to-speech - I recently got feedback about my
	animation from classmates, and they mentioned that the thing that really gave it its
	charm was the text-to-speech I used for the scenes. This poses a dilemma for me. I
	originally wanted to narrate the animation myself in a funny voice, but if the
	text-to-speech works better, then I might go down that road myself.

Figure out a way to use my 'buffRooster' model - For some reason, whenever I load
	my 'buffRooster' model it lags Unity ... I want to use this for a specific
	scene and need to figure out how to 'unlag' it. Otherwise, I'll have to figure something
	else out.

Find out way to import Witcher 2 Models - I found really cool and nice models I would
	like to use from the Witcher 2 video game! Thankfully, CD Projekt RED, the developers
	of the game, officially permit use of their models, etc so long as it is not for
	commercial reasons. At the moment, I am trying to find a way to convert the raw
	exports of the models that I have right now into compatible model formats (fbx, obj, etc)
	to use with my animation.

-- The Death of the Little Hen - A German Folktale recorded by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One time the little hen and the little rooster went to Nut Mountain, and they agreed that whoever would find a nut would share it with the other one. Now the little hen found a large, large nut, but -- wanting to eat the kernal by herself -- she said nothing about it. However, the kernal was so thick that she could not swallow it down. It got stuck in her throat, and fearing that she would choke to death, she cried out, "Little Rooster, I beg you to run as fast as you can to the well and get me some water, or else I'll choke to death."

The little rooster ran to the well as fast as he could, and said, "Well, give me some water, for the little hen is lying on Nut Mountain. She swallowed a large nut kernal and is about to choke to death on it."

The well answered, "First run to the bride, and get some red silk from her."

The little rooster ran to the bride: "Bride, give me some red silk, and I'll give the red silk to the well, and the well will give me some water, and I'll take the water to the little hen who is lying on Nut Mountain. She swallowed a large nut kernal and is about to choke to death on it."

The bride answered, "First run and get my wreath. It got caught on a willow branch."

So the little rooster ran to the willow and pulled the wreath from its branch and took it to the bride, and the bride gave him some red silk, which he took to the well, which gave him some water, and the little rooster took the water to the little hen, but when he arrived, she had already choked to death, and she lay there dead, and did not move at all.

The little rooster was so sad that he cried aloud, and all the animals came to mourn for the little hen. Six mice built a small carriage which was to carry the little hen to her grave. When the carriage was finished, they hitched themselves to it, and the little rooster drove. On the way they met the fox.

"Where are you going, little rooster?"

"I'm going to bury my little hen."

"May I ride along?"

"Yes, but you must sit at the rear, because my little horses don't like you too close to the front."

So he sat at the rear, and then the wolf, the bear, the elk, the lion, and all the animals in the forest. They rode on until they came to a brook. "How can we get across?" said the little rooster.

A straw was lying there next to the brook, and he said, "I'll lay myself across, and you can drive over me." But just as the six mice got onto the straw, it slipped into the water, and the six mice all fell in and drowned.

They did not know what to do, until a coal came and said, "I am large enough. I will lay myself across and you can drive over me." So the coal laid itself across the water, but unfortunately it touched the water, hissed, and went out; and it was dead.

A stone saw this happen, and wanting to help the little rooster, it laid itself across the water. The little rooster pulled the carriage himself. He nearly reached the other side with the dead little hen, but there were too many others seated on the back of the carriage, and the carriage rolled back, and they all fell into the water and drowned.

Now the little rooster was all alone with the dead little hen. He dug a grave for her and laid her inside. Then he made a mound on top, and sat on it, and grieved there so long that he too died. And then everyone was dead.

-- Brandon's Death of the Little Hen Script --
----------------------------------------------

SCENE 1:

Once upon a time, there was a little rooster and little hen who went to Nut Mountain to find nuts and eat them. The rooster and hen were going to share any nuts they found.

...

SCENE 2:

But the little hen was greedy and saw a really huge nut and wanted the huge nut all for herself. "Im going to eat this huge nut all by myself," said the hen. The little hen swallowed the huge nut, but then she started choking because the nut was too big.

The rooster found the hen choking and went over fast. "OH NO let me help you" said the rooster "Get some water from the well and let me drink it" said the hen and then the rooster went to the well.

...

SCENE 3:

The rooster then found the well in the forest. "WELL" said the rooster, "Give me some water, please, because the little hen is choking" "Okay but give me a apple from the bride," said the well, so the rooster went to the bride.

...

SCENE 4:

The rooster found the bride near her little farm. "Bride, give me a apple" said the rooster and the bride said "get me the wreaths from the willow tree".

...

SCENE 5:

So the rooster was flying up the willow tree and took the wreaths from the willow tree and gave the bride the wreaths to get the apple and gave the apple to the well to get the water. The rooster then remembered the hen and walked really faster to Nut Mountain to give her the water but then she was dead. "Nooooooo little hen" yelled the rooster sadly.

...

SCENE 6:

The rooster carried the hen into the village and all the animals came out and mourned for the hen in the village. The rooster wanted to bury the hen somewhere so he put the hen on a wagon that six mice built.

"Can we come along" asked the mice "Ok" said the rooster, and so the mice got onto the wagon, and then the fox got onto the wagon, and the wolf, and the bear, and the elk, and the dog too, and all the other animals that lived in the forest hopped onto wagon. The rooster then got his horses to pull the wagon into the forest to go bury the hen.

...

SCENE 7:

The rooster and the animals was walking through the forest until they came to a river. "how do we cross the river" said the rooster.

"I can be a bridge to go over" said the wheat, and it lied down on the top of river. The six mice walked over the straw but the six mice was too heavy and fell into the water and drowned and died.

"What if I am bridge to go over" said the coal, but when the coal went into the water, it died because water turns fire dead.

The rooster and the wagon and the animals almost turned around and went back because they were afraid but then they founded very big rocks to walk over so they went.

...

SCENE 8:

--- * Dramatic gameplay sequence with dramatic music here * ---

SCENE 9:

The rooster and wagon almost finished going over the river. But just as the rooster was about to walk onto the other side and finish the river, the wagon did a backflip and dropped into the water, and all the other animals were killed by drowning in the water and died.

"NOOO!!!" screamed the rooster as the animals were killed to death by the drowning. The rooster moved sadly on with the dead hen to a place on the other side of the river where he found a spot to dig grave for the hen.

...

SCENE 10:

The rooster started and finished digging a hole and put the little hen in it and created a grave on top of it then he then sat on it.

"Everyone is gone except for me even the little hen. I am fill myself with so much sadness and grief," said the rooster as he dies fast from sadness and grief. And then everyone was DEAD. The end.
